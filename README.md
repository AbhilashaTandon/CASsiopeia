# CASsiopeia

CASsiopeia (yes, you have to capitalize it like that) is a computer algebra system written in Rust. It's designed mostly for algebra and calculus. It has arbitrary precision floating point types, symbolic differentiation and integration, equation simplification, and support for multivariable calculus (gradient, divergence, curl, jacobian).

It's in a very preliminary state right now, check back later!
